/*
 * Types and discussion related to a new public interface for dns and host name resolution within the CRT.
 *
 * Why implement our own DNS:
 *
 *  (1) no other way of doing truly async DNS across all platforms (without spawning threads per resolve)
 *  (2) make it possible to support, across all platforms and runtimes, DNS resolution that goes beyond what is
 *  provided by default on a given platform (dns-over-https/tls, dns security extensions, etc...).
 *  (3) makes it possible to support name resolution strategies that improve our ability to utilize AWS services
 *
 */

/*
 * Vocabulary/Concepts
 *
 * aws_dns_resolver - A thin interface around remote DNS queries.  Includes a default implementation that supports
 * recursive and iterative queries.  Supports DNS over UDP.  (Eventually) Supports DNS over https and tls.  No support
 * for non-internet-class queries.  Uses a vtable and can be replaced with a custom implementation.
 *
 * aws_dns_service_provider_config - Controls what host/port/protocol combos the default aws_dns_resolver uses to
 * resolve queries.
 *
 * aws_host_resolution_service - A heavy-weight host name resolution service that contains CRT-specific and
 * getadrrinfo() specific functionality in the name of resolving DNS queries for CRT connections.  Contains
 * a TTL-based resolution cache and uses an aws_dns_resolver to resolve queries that the local cache cannot handle.
 * Uses a vtable and can be replaced with a custom implementation.
 * This will be the type directly used by channel setup.
 */

/*
 * Part 1 - aws_dns_service_provider_config
 * An abstraction around configuring/selecting a remote dns service provider.  Used by the default aws_dns_resolver to
 * choose an appropriate remote provider to resolve a query.
 *
 * Desired Use Cases
 *
 * (1) EzMode - You don't want to deal with a lot of configuration nonsense that you don't understand.  With minimal
 * effort or understanding, you want to have a resolver that matches standard system behavior (getaddrinfo()-based).
 *
 * (2) Testing - You're writing tests.  You want a resolver that can use custom (usually localhost-based) endpoints
 * for complete integration testing.
 *
 * (3) Privacy - You're concerned about privacy. You want a DNS resolver that does not broadcast every lookup you do.
 *
 * (4) Cache bypass (s3) - You want certain queries to bypass resolution caching as much as possible.  The only way
 * to do this is to perform iterative queries starting at the root (or nearest ancestor) to discover the authoritative
 * name server and then hit it directly with a query.
 *
 * The aws dns resolver implementation uses this abstraction, as well as a query's properties, to determine
 * which remote dns provider to use to resolve a query that is not cache-satisfiable.
 *
 * The configuration object allows you to override providers for three different categories:
 *
 *  (1) bootstrap - These providers will be used to resolve all other unresolved providers (default and root).
 *  Each host entry MUST be a resolved ipv4 or ipv6 address.
 *
 *  (2) default - These providers will be used to resolve all normal dns queries.  Roughly equivalent to the
 *  'nameserver' entries in resolv.conf.  Providers are tried sequentially until success or a timeout/retry policy
 *  failure.
 *
 *  (3) root - These providers will be used to resolve cache-bypassing
 *  iterative queries.  As the name suggests, this should literally be a list of root nameserver host names.
 *  There can be (and should be, for redundancy and reliability) more than one root provider, and an aws_dns_resolver
 *  will iterate through the full set in round robin fashion as needed.
 *
 * Why are roots necessary?  The purpose of the cache-bypass use case is to seed the local resolver cache with
 * many different results (so as to distribute connections as uniformly as possible across VIPs).  It only provides
 * value for host names that map to large sets of addresses.  It isn't sufficient to simply NOT set recursion-desired on
 * a standard query (which, by specification, will return next-step nameservers if authoritative data is not available)
 * because we don't care about the distinction between authoritative vs. cached data.  We're after distinct addresses
 * and we don't get that unless we hit the authoritative name server ourselves.
 *
 * For each category, if not overridden, an aws_dns_resolver will:
 *
 *   (1) bootstrap - Default to standard system behavior (ala /etc/resolv.conf).
 *   (2) default - Use the bootstrap providers.
 *   (3) root - Use the default providers (to resolve iterative queries).
 *
 * Returning to our original use cases:
 *
 *  (1) EzMode - Use an empty, unmodified provider config and get standard system default behavior (as if
 *  getaddrinfo() was used) in all cases.
 *
 *  (2) Testing - Set bootstrap and default to a loopback address that has a mock listener attached to it.  Roots
 *  can be set too to test iterative resolves.
 *
 *  (3) Privacy - Leave the bootstrap alone (use standard behavior to set up your default provider) but set the
 *  default to something you trust (for example, a remote host that supports dns-over-https or dns-over-tls)
 *
 *  (4) Cache bypass - Add one or more root name servers to the root category.  They will be used as the start points
 *  for resolving iterative queries (when the label cache does not have better starting information).
 *
 * Open questions (unsure if necessary):
 *
 *  (1) Do we need to publicly expose the logic that works with resolv.conf/host.conf/nsswitch.conf?

/******************************************************************************************************************
 * Part 3 - aws_host_resolution_service
 * A host-resolution service that uses an aws_dns_resolver in the service of CRT-specific host resolution functionality.
 *
 * Intended Properties:
 *   (1) Aggregation of ipv4 and ipv6 results in a single set
 *   (2) getaddrinfo() style sorting of results (via resolv.conf sortlist entry?)
 *   (3) Result caching
 *   (4) Host ranking/scoring based on connectivity/performance (API TBD)
 *   (5) Support various cache seeding strategies (for example, S3 front end addresses)
 *
 * Excluded Properties:
 *   (1) AWS service-specific policies.  Instead we support options that let an external user implement these policies.
 *
 * It's useful to acknowledge that, from the CRT's perspective, there are at least two kinds of queries we want to
 * support at the host resolution level:
 *   (1) channel setup queries - a standard name resolution process that yields ipv4 and ipv6 addresses for a connection
 *   (2) cache seeding queries - a resolution configuration that is intended to seed the internal cache with answers
 *   (ideally) ahead-of-time.  Options should exist to control how many distinct answers to try and establish.
 *
 * The current host resolution design does not support recurrent controls on cache seeding, making the assumption that
 * an external system should be responsible for over-time maintenance by making cache seeding queries periodically.
 * This is subject to change, given the privileged view the resolution service has of the cache and when it would
 * be proper to make additional queries.
 ******************************************************************************************************************/

/*
 * A host resolution query contains three sets of options (on top of what to actually look up):
 *

     * (if possible) by making 10 queries in SPREAD_N mode with N set to 10.
     *
